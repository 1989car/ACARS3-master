Required: 32 bit JRE. I packaged it with the installer.
Use Launch4J (http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/) to create executables from JARs.
- The client and server executables do not include a JAR. They only run an associated JAR file.
- These do not need to be rebuilt.
- When creating shortcuts, create shortcuts to the EXE not the JAR file.


To create installer:
- open project in Netbeans, compile.
- download/open Advanced Installer (http://www.advancedinstaller.com/)
- compile installer to generate MSI

Two versions of installers:
- one for client
- one for server


The manual is written in LaTeX. To use LaTeX, download MikTex and TexStudio (both are free). LaTeX is a typeset software; the LaTeX code is compiled into a PDF.

Installer icons need to be corrected
